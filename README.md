## 📝 Description

This project is an AI-powered photo generator that creates unique images based on text prompts or other inputs. It features a React-based frontend with space-themed UI elements and animations, while utilizing Node.js for the backend API that handles AI image generation requests.

## ✨ Features

- 🤖 AI image generation from text prompts
- 🎨 Interactive UI with space-themed elements
- 🌍 3D Earth and Stars visualizations as decorative elements
- 📱 Responsive design with card-based image gallery
- 💫 Custom animations for enhanced user experience
- 🌓 Theme customization options

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Frontend**:
  - ⚛️ React.js
  - 🎨 CSS3
  - 📜 JavaScript
  - ✨ Motion.js for animations
  
- **Backend**:
  - 🟢 Node.js
  - 🚂 Express.js (likely)
  - 🔌 Integration with AI image generation APIs
  
- **Other**:
  - 🔄 RESTful API architecture
  - 🔶 Possibly Three.js for 3D visualizations
  - 🧩 Modern component-based architecture

## 🚀 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-photo-generator.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd ai-photo-generator
   ```

3. Install dependencies for both client and server:
   ```
   npm install
   cd server
   npm install
   cd ..
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
   
   This will likely start both the React frontend and Node.js backend concurrently.

5. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

## 📋 Available Scripts
